  "about": "Ethereum is a global, decentralized platform for money and new kinds of applications. On Ethereum, you can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it's a technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee, and power decentralized applications (dApps) that everyone can use and no one can take down.\n\nThe Ethereum network is constantly evolving, with ongoing upgrades aimed at improving its scalability, security, and sustainability. The most significant of these was \"The Merge,\" which transitioned Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, drastically reducing its energy consumption.",

      "id": 9,
      "question": "What is an Ethereum wallet?",
      "answer": "An Ethereum wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive Ether (ETH) and other tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It manages your public and private keys."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "How to stay safe?",

    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Ethereum security and scam prevention",
      "answer": "Ethereum security involves understanding common scams like phishing, fake giveaways, and malicious smart contracts. Always verify URLs, use hardware wallets for significant funds, and educate yourself on best practices."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What are gas fees?",
      "answer": "Gas fees are the transaction costs on the Ethereum network, paid in Ether (ETH). They compensate miners/validators for processing and validating transactions and smart contract executions."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "How do I pay less gas?",
      "answer": "To pay less gas, transact during off-peak hours when network congestion is lower, use layer-2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum or Optimism), or utilize gas fee trackers to find optimal times."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "What causes high gas?",
      "answer": "High gas fees are primarily caused by network congestion. When many users are trying to make transactions simultaneously, the demand for block space increases, driving up gas prices."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Why do we need gas?",
      "answer": "Gas is essential to prevent spam on the network and to compensate validators for the computational resources required to process transactions and execute smart contracts, ensuring network security and stability."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "How is gas calculated?",
      "answer": "Gas is calculated based on the complexity of the transaction. Each operation on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has a gas cost. The total gas used is multiplied by the gas price (Gwei) to get the total fee."
