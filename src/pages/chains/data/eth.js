  { id: 1, question: 'What is Ethereum?', answer: 'Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. It is the most actively used blockchain.', },
  { id: 2, question: 'Who runs Ethereum?', answer: 'Ethereum is maintained by a global network of decentralized nodes, meaning no single entity "runs" it. It\'s a community-driven project with contributions from developers worldwide.', },
  { id: 3, question: 'What are smart contracts?', answer: 'Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on the blockchain and automatically execute when conditions are met.', },
  { id: 4, question: 'What about Ethereum\'s energy consumption?', answer: 'Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with "The Merge," significantly reducing its energy consumption by over 99%.', },
  { id: 5, question: 'What is the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin?', answer: 'Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency for transactions, while Ethereum is a platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, with Ether as its native token.', },
  { id: 6, question: 'What is Web3?', answer: 'Web3 refers to the next generation of the internet, built on decentralized blockchain technologies, enabling peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries.', },
  { id: 7, question: 'Why is Web3 important?', answer: 'Web3 aims to give users more control over their data and digital identities, fostering a more open, transparent, and decentralized internet.', },
  { id: 8, question: 'What is ether (ETH)?', answer: 'Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for transaction fees (gas) and as a store of value.', },
  { id: 9, question: 'What is an Ethereum wallet?', answer: 'An Ethereum wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive Ether (ETH) and other tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It manages your public and private keys.', },
  { id: 10, question: 'How to stay safe?', answer: 'To stay safe, always use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), be wary of phishing scams, and use reputable wallets and exchanges. Never share your private keys or seed phrase.', },
  { id: 11, question: 'Ethereum security and scam prevention', answer: 'Ethereum security involves understanding common scams like phishing, fake giveaways, and malicious smart contracts. Always verify URLs, use hardware wallets for significant funds, and educate yourself on best practices.', },
  { id: 12, question: 'What are gas fees?', answer: 'Gas fees are the transaction costs on the Ethereum network, paid in Ether (ETH). They compensate miners/validators for processing and validating transactions and smart contract executions.', },
  { id: 13, question: 'How do I pay less gas?', answer: 'To pay less gas, transact during off-peak hours when network congestion is lower, use layer-2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum or Optimism), or utilize gas fee trackers to find optimal times.', },
  { id: 14, question: 'What causes high gas?', answer: 'High gas fees are primarily caused by network congestion. When many users are trying to make transactions simultaneously, the demand for block space increases, driving up gas prices.', },
  { id: 15, question: 'Why do we need gas?', answer: 'Gas is essential to prevent spam on the network and to compensate validators for the computational resources required to process transactions and execute smart contracts, ensuring network security and stability.', },
  { id: 16, question: 'How is gas calculated?', answer: 'Gas is calculated based on the complexity of the transaction. Each operation on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has a gas cost. The total gas used is multiplied by the gas price (Gwei) to get the total fee.', },
